# Supercapacitor-Bus

This is one of the freelance projects I worked on, focused on utilizing `supercapacitors` as an alternative to batteries for energy storage in buses. In metropolitan cities, buses make frequent stops, typically halting for around `15â€“20` seconds at each stop. This brief duration is sufficient for supercapacitors to charge to a level that can power the bus to the next stop. To demonstrate this concept, I created a working prototype of a bus equipped with two `2.7V, 100F` supercapacitors and controlled using an `RC transmitter` and receiver. An `OLED display` is used to show the capacitor's charge level and timing in real time. For the charging mechanism, a `pantograph-style` system is implemented, simulating how a real bus might connect to a `charging terminal` during stops.
